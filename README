== Extending
 The Audit Extension was designed to be extensible so logging of any non-core Radiant functionality can be added.  The AuditEvent model logs your transactions...
 
 In general, logging follows one of two patterns.  The Observer pattern can be used to monitor ActiveRecord model actions.  To observe a model, add the model to the Observables array in audit_extension.rb and send the model
 If, say, your extension creates or updates Pages and you don't want redundant log messages from both the Page model and your extension, you can disable logging by setting AuditEvent.logging_disabled to true. ***
